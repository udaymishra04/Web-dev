#CSS
- CSS stands for cascading style sheet.
- It is a language used to give styling and design to websites.
- It is the standard for styling websites, used by most/all websites across the globe.
- It usually goes hand-in-hand with HTML, while CSS3(the latest version) brings lots of new features to the table.

Reasons to use CSS:
- Styling
- Layout and Design
- Animations
- Font changes
- Orgarnizations
- Grid Systems

- CSS selectors can be used to address parts of the page to syle and use.
- HTML elements are given class and ID attributes, which are then used to manipulate in CSS.

What is a Selector
- Selectors are ways of grabbing and manipulating HTML.
- There are many different ways to select, however they all turn out the same way.
- Different selectors have different applications.
 
Types:
1. The element selector
- You can select entire elements without any special characters.
- This applies to all the elements with that tag on the page.
- It ranks on the bottom of the specificity scale.

2. The class selector
- This is used to select elements with a certain class name. 
- Can be used on any and all elements with that class.
- Can be used multiple times, and is selet with the .symbol.

3. The ID selector
- This is used to select elements with a certain ID name.
- Can be used on any and all elements with that ID
- Unlike classes, it can only be used on one elements at a time, and is selected with the # symbol. However, it is possible to use more than once.

        <h3>Taco Trivia</h3>

              When did tacos first appear in the United States?
            </summary>
            <p>The Taco was first introduced to the United States in 1905. Mexican
              migrants were coming in to work on railroads and other jobs and
              started to bring their delicious food with them. Tacos were
              essentially a street food at this time since they were highly
              portable and cheap.</p>
